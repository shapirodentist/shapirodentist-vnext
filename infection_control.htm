                  has been a great deal of concern in the last few years about 
                  the possibilities of cross contamination and of infectious 
                  diseases that might be transmitted to patients in dental 
                  offices as well as other health care settings. The case of Dr. 
                  Acer, a Florida dentist who allegedly transmitted the AIDS 
                  virus to five of his patients several years ago, as well as a 
                  recent study, heavily reported in the media, indicating that 
                  the AIDS virus could conceivably be transmitted through dental 
                  handpieces (the high speed drills) and prophy angles (the 
                  device used to polish teeth at cleanings), have caused a great 
                  deal of legitimate concern and anxiety.</DIV>
                  <DIV><BR>While the more frightening and sensational aspects of 
                  these issues get a big splash in the media when they occur, 
                  the follow up studies often do not. For instance, last spring 
                  the CDC issued a report that followed nearly 16,000 patients 
                  of 32 dentists and physicians infected with the AIDS virus and 
                  have found no patients (other than the five cases linked to 
                  Dr. Acer) infected during treatment. They go on to conclude 
                  that the risk for HIV transmission from an infected 
                  health-care worker to a patient is very low. Also CDC 
                  researchers and Florida health officials both reported that 
                  after two years of intensive investigation of the Dr. Acer 
                  case (the sole case of this type since the beginning of the 
                  epidemic) they still do not know how the disease was 
                  transmitted to his patients and are closing the case. They 
                  reported that they can only conclude that Dr. Acer directly 
                  infected his patients, rather than somehow passing the virus 
                  from another infected patient. There has even been 
                  speculation, corroborated by a close friend of Dr. Acer, that 
                  he may have infected those patients deliberately. <BR></DIV>
                  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
                  <DIV>I've been asked, why treat HIV positive patients? First 
                  there is an ethical obligation to treat, second we're not 
                  always aware of someone's status (in spite of consistent 
                  updating of each patient's medical histories, sometimes 
                  patients don't know their status or won't admit it), and third 
                  the Federal government has ruled the disease is a handicap, 
                  and as such to refuse to treat someone because of their HIV 
                  status is illegal discrimination against the handicapped and 
                  can result in license loss and/or fines up to 
                  $10,000.<BR></DIV>
                  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
                  <DIV>Modern dentistry has always been concerned with infection 
                  control. Frankly the main focus of infection control in 
                  health-care settings has always been Hepatitis B, a virus that 
                  is stronger, more common, and more difficult to kill than HIV. 
                  It is also highly virulent--a person is about 1000 times more 
                  likely to become Hepatitis B positive than HIV positive if 
                  their blood was exposed to both. Fortunately, due to the 
                  precautions taken in disinfection and sterilization, the 
                  spread of Hepatitis B in dental offices has been minuscule. 
                  The last case of Hepatitis B spread from dentist to patient 
                  was in 1985, and there has never been any spread by a dentist 
                  wearing gloves. The CDC has no cases of Hepatitis B spread 
                  from patient to patient at a dental office.<BR>&nbsp;</DIV>
                  <DIV>Does all this mean, however, that we can be complacent? 
                  Quite the contrary in recent years dentists have stepped up 
                  their infection control measures dramatically. We are 
                  constantly improving our abilities to achieve higher and 
                  higher levels of protection. Technology now exists, for 
                  example, for us to have handpieces that can be sterilized in 
                  an autoclave (an autoclave works by injecting superheated, 
                  pressurized steam into a chamber where the instruments to be 
                  sterilized are placed--no virus, bacteria or spore can live 
                  through this). <BR></DIV>
                  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
                  <DIV>The good news is that contracting a disease in a dental 
                  office is highly unlikely. Additional good news is that by 
                  following what is called "universal precautions" (that means 
                  treating every patient and health-care worker as a potential 
                  source of infection) and following the recommendations, 
                  regulations and guidelines of the CDC, American Dental 
                  Association, OSHA, and the EPA, dental treatment can be made 
                  extraordinarily safe. The bad news may be that the cost of 
                  health-care is going up because of the additional measures 
                  being taken (it is estimated, that these additional costs are 
                  between $8-$14 per dental patient visit. At least a $4 billion 
                  yearly increase in dental health-care costs alone).<BR></DIV>
                  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
                  <DIV>I'd like to list some of the types of sterilization and 
                  infection control procedures that should be used in dental 
                  offices (these are designed to protect the safety of patients 
                  and staff). The heart of any infection control program must be 
                  a high quality autoclave (ours, for instance, is computerized 
                  to self diagnose and alert us of any problem), the autoclave 
                  should be monitored routinely, for proper function either by 
                  the dental office or, preferably, by an independent lab. After 
                  each use all dental instruments, handpieces, prophy angles, 
                  etc. Should be cleaned manually or preferably in an ultrasonic 
                  cleaning machine (recently in our office we've been using an 
                  enzyme treatment, that has become available for use in the 
                  ultrasonic machine, which dissolves organic matter) and then 
                  autoclaved in a sealed pouch. </DIV>
                  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
                  <DIV>We use as many items as possible that can be disposed of 
                  after a single use, for instance needles, scalpels, gauze, 
                  suction tips, cotton products, etc. (In our office we even use 
                  single use disposable trays to place our instruments on) these 
                  need to be handled and disposed of in compliance with EPA, 
                  OSHA and local regulations to prevent accidental cuts or 
                  contamination. One of the most important, yet rarely 
                  mentioned, procedures is hand washing before every patient 
                  contact with an anti-microbial soap. A new pair of gloves must 
                  be used for every patient. Face protection must be worn when 
                  there is any aerosol created. All personnel should be 
                  vaccinated against Hepatitis B. Any surface likely to be 
                  touched, such as X-ray and chair switches, counter tops, X-ray 
                  machines, light handles, faucet handles, hoses, soap 
                  dispensers, etc. should have a disposable cover or be treated 
                  with two applications of a hospital-grade, tuberculocidal, EPA 
                  approved, surface disinfectant following stringent CDC 
                  guidelines, or modified to be non-hand operated. </DIV>
                  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
                  <DIV>Recently, there have been concerns about the water, that 
                  is emitted from dental apparatus waterlines. This potential 
                  problem area continues to be researched, and waterline safety 
                  technologies, continue to evolve.&nbsp;To deal with this 
                  issue, we have installed water delivery systems which supply 
                  water independent of, and unattached to the municipal water 
                  system.&nbsp; The water supplied through this system is 
                  treated with anti-microbials.&nbsp; Also the system is 
                  routinely treated and then flushed with anti-microbials--a 
                  regimen proven effective in research published in the Journal 
                  of the American&nbsp;Dental Association.&nbsp;</DIV>
                  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
                  <DIV>You should feel comfortable to ask your dentist about his 
                  or her infection control measures. I think you will find that 
                  a great deal is being done for your 
                  protection.<BR><BR>-Richard B. Shapiro, D.D.S. (404)523-2514
